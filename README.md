# se-day-2-git-and-github
## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version Control enables the developer to oversee every commit, review, collaborate and ensure code Integrity and faster releases.
Github enables developers to collaborate and work on a certain repository. One can keep track of the projects and this will enhance Integrity.
## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
Ensure you have a GitHub Account and Sign in. Click on new Repository. Fill in all the areas marked in Asteric, i.e. The repository name, whether you want your repository to be public or private. Initialize the repository by specifying whether it's Read me repo. Finally proceed and click on create repository.

## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
ReadMe enables developers to edit and make changes on the code.
Ensure you name the ReadME File so that is easily associated with the data file it describes. Write it as a plain text file, avoiding proprietary formats such as MS Word.
## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
Public Repository enables other developers to contribute and make changes on the repository unlike a private repository where only the user can make changes to it.
Public repository enables developers too pull in and share their contributions in the project. This creates a diverse pool of thoughts unlike in a private repository where there's monotony of thoughts.
## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
Start by Initializing a new Git Repository - git init. Add files to the staging area - git add <file-name>. Then commit your changes - git commit -m"Insert your commit message"
Commits enables the user to change point or save a point by adding the message.
Adding commits keep track of the progress and changes, It's a point in the prpject you can go back to if you find a bug or want to make a change.

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
A branch is a new or separate version of the main repository. It allows users to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.
Creating a new branch - git branch"Insert the repository name"
Checkout the branch - git checkout "repository name"
Merge the branch to the main repository - git merge

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
Pull request enables developers to be up to date on projects they are collaboartaively working on with the help of fetch and merge commands.
